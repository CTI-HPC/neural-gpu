INTRODUCTION

The GPU Controller is a class to calculate a feedforward network FFN.

FILES


Class GPUController
	GPUController c(N, H, M);
	c.load_parameters("model-directory") // model-directory is the directory where the files weights_ih.txt and weights_ho.txt are. 
	c.push(input, N)                     // input is a pointer to the input data and N is its size
	float *output = c.get_output()       // return a pointer to the output data


COMPILING AND RUNNING

The compilation and running will take place in the cluster as a job.

% cd gpu-controller/ 
% qsub send-cluster.sh
