\section{ZeroMQ}

The current message-passing implementation based on the ZeroMQ library
 the following details.

\begin{description}
    \item [Transport:]
        TCP transport is used,
        because it is one of the best transports methods implemented
        in the last version of ZeroMQ.
    \item [Infrastructure:]
        The \emph{Queue} infrastructure is used,
        which is used to implement a client/server model.
    \item [Messaging pattern:]
        The \emph{Request/Response} model was selected,
        which is unidirectional communication from a client
        to servers. This model implies synchronization between the \texttt{send()}
        and the \texttt{recv()} method, ensuring that no messages will be lost.

\subsection*{Default values}

The current version uses some default values to do the
connection between the clients and servers.

Both communication use the \texttt{TCP} protocol
and the \texttt{127.0.0.1} IP address,
but the connection between the \texttt{Input} and the \texttt{GPUControllerService}
use the port \texttt{5000} and the connection between the \texttt{GPUControllerService}
and the \texttt{Output} use the port \texttt{5050}.
